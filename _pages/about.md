I am a final year PhD student in computer science at the University of Nottingham, affiliated to the Horizon CDT and <a href="#">Computer Vision Lab</a>. 
I am primarily supervised by <a href="#">Dr. Yorgos Tzimiropoulos</a> and <a href="#">Prof Michel Valstar</a>. My supervision team also includes  <a href="#">Dr. Elvira Perez Vallejos</a>, <a href="#"> Prof Richard Morris</a>. 

My PhD is about automatic assessment of mood for detecting markers of depression and anxiety, in videos collected under challenging, in-the-wild conditions. During my PhD I have worked on extensive topics in computer vision and machine learning including human pose estimation, face alignment, super-resolution, face and human body image synthesis and manipulation using GANs, domain adaptation and emotion recognition. 

My notable previous work includes automated harvesting of broccoli, completed in collaboration with  <a href="#">Prof Tom Duckett</a>, University of Lincoln. I attained my taught Masters degree in computer science from the University of Leeds and research masters degree in computer vision and machine learning from the university of Lincoln. I recently completed an internship at the  <a href="#">Blue Skeye AI</a> an exciting AI start-up, on social gaze estimation.

When I am not occupied with my work, I go for long distance walks, enjoy crossfit, mixed-media painting, reading, dancing, cooking and contemplating.
