I am a final year PhD student in computer science at the University of Nottingham, affiliated to the Horizon CDT and Computer Vision Lab<a href="#">elit</a>. I am primarily supervised by Prof Michel Valstar. My supervision team also includes Dr. Elvira Perez Vallejos, Prof Richard Morris and Dr. Yorgos Tzimiropoulos. My PhD is about automatic assessment of mood for detecting markers of depression and anxiety, in videos collected under challenging, in-the-wild conditions. During my PhD I have worked on extensive topics in computer vision and machine learning including human pose estimation, face alignment, super-resolution, face and human body image synthesis and manipulation using GANs, domain adaptation and emotion recognition. 
My notable previous work includes automated harvesting of broccoli, completed in collaboration with Prof Tom Duckett, University of Lincoln. I attained my taught Masters degree in computer science from the University of Leeds and research masters degree in computer vision and machine learning from the university of Lincoln. I recently completed an internship at the exciting start-up company, Blue Skeye AI, on social gaze estimation.
When I am not occupied with my work, I go for long distance walks, enjoy crossfit, mixed-media painting, reading, dancing, cooking and contemplating.
